# Ruby client for [OpenMeteo](https://github.com/open-meteo/open-meteo)

... in progress.

> NOTE: [There is a plan to create official SDKs](https://github.com/open-meteo/open-meteo-website/issues/40) via [FlatBuffers](https://flatbuffers.dev/). However, I couldn't find a Ruby implementation of FlatBuffers in general. Hence, most likely, there won't be a Ruby SDK in the near future.

## Development

Useful commands are defined in the [`Justfile`](Justfile) and can be listed with [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just).

E.g. execute an [example](example.rb) request: `just example`.
